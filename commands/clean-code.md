Review code against Clean Code standards:

$ARGUMENTS

Load the `axe-method:clean-code` skill and follow the protocol defined there.

Scan for hard rule violations (naming, functions, comments, error handling, boundaries, structure). Fix each violation. Read as a stranger would. If you have to explain it, it isn't clean yet.
